    "We implemented the unknown a_i with help of the three different ways.

If we plot the discrete values and the function it fits really well. \n",

    "For the qr factorization we need the qr factorization command or compute it and we need also one transpose, one product and one solution of a linear equation system. (about 344ms)\n",
    "For the last solution, the svd decomposition, we need the svd decomposition, two inverses, three products and build the diagonal matrix with the diagonal entries from the svd decomposition. (123ms)\n",
    "It seems that the svd takes the most time because there are the most calculations. But even when executing the program with the existing A and the stored solution the normal equation takes the most time (about 20ms). \n",
    "We think the execution time of the last method is so good, because we don't have to use the solve command. We can built the inverse of the diagonal matrix very easy so that we can use $x=A^{-1}*b$ to solve the linear equation. \n",
