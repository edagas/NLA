    "We implemented the QR algorithm with Rayleigh shifts and deflations, as indicated (see Appendix for the code).\n",
    "For the Rayleigh shift we chose (as suggested in litterature) the last diagonal element of the matrix A (and of the submatrix due to the deflation). In fact, when trying the another element, the algorithm doesn't converge as well (sometimes not at all after 1000 iterations). \n",
    "\n",
    "We handled the deflation in the following way: once the off-diagonal elements adjacent to the last diagonal element were close to zero (smaller than 1.e-8 in absolute value), we considered an an eigenvalue as found, namely the diagonal element. We saved it, set the off-diagonal elements to 0, and repeated the iterations, but with the submatrix without the last row and column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works mostly well for dimensions at least up to 50. Then it converges for around 100 iterations. For n=5 it converges for around 10 iterations. It happens sometimes (more often for larger dimensions) that it does not converge (well or at all). This could be caused by the eigenvalues of the matrix, if they are close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to start the algortihm with a tridiagonal matrix, we wrote a method for the Householder reduction to a Hessenberg matrix (tridiagonal for a symmetric matrix A).\n",
    "\n",
    "Something seems to happen to the matrix the first iterations, before any eigenvalue is found. The first diagonal element becomes big and does not change much while all the other values are found. But this value is not the last eigenvalue, whereas the algorithm should give that. So instead we take the diagonal element of the tridiagonal matrix we started out with as the last eigenvalue, when all the others are found (and this corresponds well)."
